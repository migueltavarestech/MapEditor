Graphical interface built with Java7 
where you're presented with a grid.
<br/>
The user can do the following:
<br/>
<br/>ARROW KEYS: Move between each square
<br/>SPACE: fill them with colour
<br/>S: Save your current grid
<br/>C: clear your current grid
<br/>L: load previous grids.
<br/>
<br/>
This uses the library Simple Graphics from 
<Academia de CÃ³digo_>.
